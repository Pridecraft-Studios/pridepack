Water is attracted to water (something being attracted to water is also known as hydrophilic). You could reword water is hydrophilic as water is homophilic (homo meaning same and philic meaning having an affinity for). Someone being homophilic is being homosexual. Thus, water is gay. (Confirmed by real chemists)
Glass is not considered to be a solid or liquid. Since the states of matter can be considered the genders of matter this means that glass agender. (Confirmed by real chemists)
The noble gases don't like making bonds. This means that they are aroace. (Confirmed by real chemists)
