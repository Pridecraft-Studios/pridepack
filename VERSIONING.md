# Pridepack Versioning

The versioning shall consist of three elements:

- Major Version `M.u.f`
- Update Version `m.U.f`
- Fix Version `m.u.F`

With `major` being bumped in relation to Minecraft's <!-- major release --> Game Drops,
and the other ones following [`semver`](https://semver.org)

For example, when [Minecraft 26.1](https://minecraft.wiki/w/26.1) <!-- lol broken link -->
comes out, Pridepack's version will be
[Pridepack 12.0](https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/pridepack/releases/tag/v12.0).
We will not bump the major version yearly like Mojang does, we'll base our
versions on Game Drops.
